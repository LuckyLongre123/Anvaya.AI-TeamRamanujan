# 🏛️ README – User 4 (Denver-LB Council Sync) 
## Project: Municipal Policy & Zoning Oversight

---

## 📌 Overview
This dataset represents the legislative coordination and municipal oversight for the **Denver and Long Beach City Councils** during Q1 2014. Managed by the **Legislative Coordinator (test4)**, the project focuses on zoning reclassifications, public health contracts, and neighborhood development loans.

The dataset captures the complexity of city governance, including budget reallocations, public hearings, and the balance between urban development and regulatory compliance.

---

## 🧩 Core Scenario
The City Council must navigate the "Omnibus" zoning package and critical social funding while managing multi-million dollar franchise renewals.

### Key Focus Areas:
- **Zoning Overhaul:** Transitioning properties (like 8822 Bee) to Mixed-Use (M-MX-5).
- **Social Impact:** Funding the Colorado AIDS Project (CAP) via a $2M contract.
- **Neighborhood Growth:** Expanding loans for Del Norte Neighborhood Development.
- **Public Recognition:** Managing official proclamations (MLK Jr., National Western Stock Show).

## 🔄 Key Conflicts
1. **Zoning Density vs. Building Limits:** High-density mixed-use changes flagged for "bulk plane" limitations.
2. **Budget Allocation:** Ensuring franchise renewal fees cover social contracts without depleting the General Fund.
3. **Execution Speed:** Getting the 108th National Western Stock Show proclamation ready under tight deadlines.

---

## ⚠ Identified Risks
- **Regulatory Exposure:** Non-compliance with the Billboard Ordinance restatements.
- **Funding Delays:** Gap in Del Norte loan approval affecting neighborhood housing timelines.
- **Community Impact:** Potential risks to health services if the CAP contract fails compliance checks.

---

## ❓ Ambiguities
- **Legal Sufficiency:** Are "interim mitigation" measures enough to satisfy the billboard ordinance?
- **Budgetary Source:** Internal confusion between General Revenue vs. Special Franchise fees for specific projects.

---

## 🔁 Contradiction Mapping
- **Audit Purpose:** Labeled as "corrective," but resulted in significant high-density zoning flags.
- **Financial Pivot:** CFO/Budget Reviewer initially hesitated on funds but approved an additional $1M later.
- **Policy Workaround:** Use of temporary traffic caps as a substitute for long-term legislative fixes.
