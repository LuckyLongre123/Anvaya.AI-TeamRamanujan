MEETING: Denver-Long Beach Legislative Joint Review Session

DATE: January 13, 2014

PARTICIPANTS: Speaker 1 (Council President), Speaker 2 (Legal/Clerk), Speaker 3 (Secretary), Speaker 5 (Budget Reviewer), Councilman Herndon, Councilwoman Ortega.

[00:05:10] Speaker 3 (Secretary): We have reconvened for the final required public hearing of the evening. The focus is on the "Omnibus" package. This is not just a simple change; it’s a substantive, clarifying, and corrective overhaul of the Denver Zoning Code.

[00:06:25] Speaker 1 (President): Specifically, let’s look at Council Bill 13-0589. It’s regarding Chapter 59-2. Councilwoman Ortega, do you have the floor?

[00:06:40] Speaker 6 (Ortega): Thank you. As you all know, we’ve heard hours of testimony. This bill is about bulk plane limitations. If we don’t approve this rezoning for the property at 8822 Bee, we leave a gap in how land is partitioned from M-RX-5 to M-MX-5. This is about community building, not just paperwork.

[00:08:15] Speaker 5 (Budget Reviewer): Just a moment. I’m looking at the numbers here. Is this the same package that includes the $2 million franchise renewal fee? I want to be absolutely sure we aren't pulling from the General Government Special Revenue Fund for the wrong line item.

[00:09:02] Speaker 2 (Legal/Clerk): To clarify for Speaker 5: This particular ordinance is asking to allow an additional $1,000,000 to be added to the existing loan agreement with the Del Norte Neighborhood Development Corporation. The franchise fee is a separate matter, though both are on tonight’s agenda.

[00:10:45] Speaker 6 (Ortega): Right. We need to focus. If we delay the Del Norte amendment, we risk stalling the neighborhood project. I move that we close the voting.

[00:12:30] Speaker 3 (Secretary): Ortega—Aye. Madam President—Aye. Madam Secretary, please close the voting and announce the results.

[00:13:05] Speaker 1 (President): 13 Eyes. Zero Nays. The council bill passes.

[00:14:20] Speaker 2 (Legal/Clerk): Moving on to the Long Beach communication. Recommendation to request the City Manager to provide an update on the Long Beach Police Department’s status. Also, we have a report from Technology Services (ITB TS-14-025) regarding architectural and engineering services contracts.

[00:16:50] Speaker 5 (Budget Reviewer): Before we adjourn, what about the Martin Luther King Jr. proclamation?

[00:17:15] Speaker 1 (President): Yes, that’s next. It’s a very proud moment for the council—celebrating the 50th Anniversary of his visit to Denver’s Park Hill. It sets the tone for our 2014 sessions.

[00:19:00] Speaker 3 (Secretary): Thank you, everyone. We will reconvene for the billboard ordinance and the "Plastic and Paper Bag Fee" proposal in the next session. Meeting adjourned.
