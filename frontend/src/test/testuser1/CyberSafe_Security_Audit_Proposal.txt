1. Background

As part of the Checkout Flow Optimization initiative, payment processing security and regulatory compliance were identified as critical success factors.

Given that the platform processes card-based transactions and operates under a “Pro Tier” payment processing license, compliance with PCI-DSS standards is mandatory.

Internal technical reviews indicated that a third-party audit may be necessary to meet both insurance and licensing requirements.

2. Vendor Selection

After preliminary evaluation, the company received a formal proposal from:

Vendor: CyberSafe Security Solutions
Authorized Signatory: Sarah Jenkins (Lead Auditor)

The vendor specializes in:

PCI-DSS Level 2 Readiness Assessment

Penetration Testing of Microservices Architecture

Security Vulnerability Reporting & Remediation Advisory

3. Scope of Work (As Proposed)

The vendor will provide:

Comprehensive penetration testing of checkout-related microservices.

PCI-DSS Level 2 compliance readiness assessment.

Formal vulnerability remediation report.

Risk documentation aligned with insurance policy requirements.

This assessment covers both:

Backend payment microservices

API-level exposure risks

Tokenization & encryption practices

4. Cost & Timeline

Total Cost: $15,000 USD

Timeline: 14 business days from official project kickoff

This cost is fixed under the current proposal and excludes additional remediation implementation costs.

5. Mandatory Compliance Clause

The vendor proposal explicitly states:

The external audit is strictly required for maintaining the “Pro Tier” payment processing license.

Internal security scans are insufficient under the company’s current insurance policy.

Failure to conduct third-party validation may result in:

License downgrade or suspension

Insurance policy non-compliance

Increased legal exposure in case of breach

This clause introduces a regulatory dependency within the project.

6. Conflict & Internal Discussion

There is ongoing internal discussion regarding:

Removing the external audit to reduce project cost.

Attempting to rely solely on internal security scans.

Deferring third-party validation to a later quarter.

However, based on vendor documentation:

External audit appears non-optional for full compliance.

Skipping the audit may block Pro Tier license eligibility.

Budget reduction decisions may conflict with compliance obligations.

7. Risk Implications

If external audit is removed:

Compliance Risk: High

Insurance Risk: High

Payment License Risk: Critical

Reputational Risk: High

If audit is conducted:

Project cost increases by $15,000.

Timeline increases by minimum 14 business days.

Budget cap pressure increases.

8. Governance Impact

Decision ownership:

CFO: Budget approval authority

CTO: Technical security assessment authority

CEO: Final business risk decision

This creates a potential decision conflict scenario if:

CFO prioritizes cost reduction

CTO advises compliance adherence

CEO prioritizes revenue acceleration
