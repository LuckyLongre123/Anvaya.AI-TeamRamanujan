MEETING: Technical Architecture Review (Stakeholders Sync)
DATE: Feb 05, 2024
PARTICIPANTS: Alex Chen (CEO), Rajesh Patel (CTO), Maria Santos (CFO)

[00:05:12] Rajesh (CTO): I’ve shared the CyberSafe PCI-DSS audit proposal. It’s $15,000. If we want certification before launch, we need to sign by Friday to stay on track for March 31.

[00:05:38] Alex (CEO): So without this audit, are we technically non-compliant?

[00:05:50] Rajesh (CTO): Not exactly non-compliant… but we won’t have third-party certification. Internal scans alone don’t qualify as official PCI validation.

[00:06:45] Maria (CFO): I’m reviewing the project allocation. The total cap is $55k. If we approve this $15k audit, we’ll have to cut Stripe senior integration support.

[00:07:02] Alex (CEO): And cutting Stripe resources means?

[00:07:10] Maria (CFO): Slower checkout optimization. Possibly missing the investor demo deadline.

[00:07:30] Alex (CEO): What if we move the audit to Q2? After launch?

[00:07:45] Rajesh (CTO): That increases exposure. If there’s a breach, insurance may question the lack of certified compliance. Internal scans won’t fully protect us legally.

[00:08:05] Alex (CEO): But from a probability standpoint, how likely is a breach in the next six weeks?

[00:08:18] Rajesh (CTO): Probability might be low, but impact would be severe. Financially and reputationally.

[00:08:40] Maria (CFO): Also, remember — investors are expecting conversion uplift this quarter. Delays directly affect revenue projections.

[00:09:05] Alex (CEO): Understood. Compliance is important, but launch is non-negotiable. We cannot exceed $55k.

[00:09:22] Rajesh (CTO): So we’re accepting documented risk?

[00:09:30] Alex (CEO): Yes. Skip the external audit for now. Redirect the $15k toward development and Stripe optimization. We’ll document internal scans as partial mitigation.

[00:09:50] Maria (CFO): Budget locked at $55k. No allocation for external audit in Phase 1.

[00:10:05] Rajesh (CTO): I’ll log this as a high-risk compliance deferment and prepare internal documentation.

[00:10:20] Alex (CEO): Good. We revisit PCI certification in Q2 post-launch.
