PROPOSAL: FinSafe Infrastructure Remediation & Compliance Alignment
DATE: March 13, 2024
PREPARED BY: Daniel Brooks (Head of Engineering)
SUBMITTED TO: Sarah Mitchell (CEO) / Laura Kim (CFO)

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
Due to the failure of the Real-Time Payment Verification API under load, this proposal outlines the emergency implementation of Redis Caching and Load Balancer refactoring to prevent financial misreporting and ensure compliance.

2. SCOPE OF WORK
- Emergency Redis Implementation: Deploy distributed caching to reduce 3rd-party API calls.
- Load Balancer Refactor: Implement traffic shaping and concurrency limits (interim).
- Reconciliation Audit: Scripting to verify frontend "Approved" states against backend "Pending" states.
- Compliance Documentation: Formal report for Ethan Clark regarding data integrity safeguards.

3. TIMELINE & MILESTONES
- Phase 1 (Days 1-5): Redis Caching deployment & Stress Testing.
- Phase 2 (Days 6-10): Load Balancer refactor & Production dry-run.

4. BUDGET ESTIMATE
- Infrastructure Scaling Costs: $8,500 (Additional Cloud Resources)
- External Audit Review: $4,000 (Required for Compliance sign-off post-fix)
Total Estimated Cost: $12,500 USD

5. MANDATORY COMPLIANCE NOTE
Launching without these fixes violates the "Data Accuracy and Financial Reporting" section of our regulatory charter. Engineering and Compliance strongly advise against a "Live" launch before Phase 2 completion.
