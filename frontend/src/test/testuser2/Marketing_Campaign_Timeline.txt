MEETING: Emergency Engineering & Compliance Review
DATE: March 12, 2024
PARTICIPANTS: Sarah Mitchell (CEO), Daniel Brooks (Head of Engineering), Laura Kim (CFO), Ethan Clark (Compliance Officer)

[00:02:10] Daniel (Head of Engineering): We ran stress tests last night. The Real-Time Payment Verification API failed at 200 concurrent requests.
[00:02:25] Sarah (CEO): Failed how?
[00:02:32] Daniel (Head of Engineering): Transactions show as “Approved” on the frontend, but backend reconciliation marks them as “Pending.” In some cases, balances temporarily display incorrect values.
[00:02:55] Laura (CFO): Incorrect balances? As in financial misreporting?
[00:03:05] Daniel (Head of Engineering): Temporarily, yes. It corrects after refresh, but during load spikes it’s unstable.
[00:03:20] Ethan (Compliance Officer): That’s not minor. Even temporary inconsistencies can trigger compliance violations.
[00:03:40] Sarah (CEO): What’s the root cause?
[00:03:48] Daniel (Head of Engineering): The third-party payment gateway is rate-limiting us. Their API throttles after a certain threshold. We don’t have sufficient Redis caching implemented.
[00:04:15] Laura (CFO): How long to fix?
[00:04:22] Daniel (Head of Engineering): Five days for Redis caching. Another five to refactor the load balancer properly.
[00:04:40] Sarah (CEO): That pushes us past the investor launch window.
[00:04:55] Ethan (Compliance Officer): Launching like this risks regulatory scrutiny. If transaction states mismatch, that’s a reporting issue.
[00:05:12] Laura (CFO): And if users see $0.00 or incorrect balances, that’s a PR disaster.
[00:05:30] Sarah (CEO): What’s the probability this happens in real traffic?
[00:05:42] Daniel (Head of Engineering): Under moderate load, low. Under high traffic — very likely.
[00:06:05] Sarah (CEO): Can we temporarily limit user concurrency?
[00:06:15] Daniel (Head of Engineering): Yes, but that caps growth. And it’s a workaround, not a fix.
[00:06:40] Ethan (Compliance Officer): From a compliance standpoint, I cannot recommend launch in current state.
[00:07:05] Sarah (CEO): If we delay by 10 days, can we guarantee stability?
[00:07:15] Daniel (Head of Engineering): With caching and load balancing refactor — yes, significantly reduced risk.
[00:07:40] Laura (CFO): Delaying affects investor confidence. Launch failure affects market trust permanently.
[00:08:10] Sarah (CEO): Understood. I need 24 hours to decide whether we delay or implement traffic caps as interim mitigation.
[00:08:30] Daniel (Head of Engineering): I’ll prepare a formal risk documentation and vendor escalation note.
