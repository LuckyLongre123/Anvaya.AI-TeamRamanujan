# 🏛️ README – User 5 (Michael Vance)
## Project: Municipal Policy & Infrastructure Oversight (2014-2015)

---

## 📌 Overview
This dataset tracks the legislative actions and coordination handled by **Michael Vance**. It spans three city councils (Denver, Long Beach, Alameda) and highlights the friction between bureaucratic processes, external vendor interests, and legal compliance.

## ⚔️ Conflict Matrix (Stakeholder Friction)

| Conflict Point | Stakeholder A | Stakeholder B | Nature of Conflict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Airport Refurbishment** | Speaker 7 (Council) | Denver Airport Ent. (DAE) | **Safety vs. Efficiency:** Speaker 7 is concerned that eliminating mid-term checks reduces oversight; DAE wants a streamlined process. |
| **Alameda Lease** | Speaker 0 (Presiding) | City Official Staff | **Process vs. Authority:** Council was ready for "Final Passage," but internal staff blocked it citing unseen compliance issues. |
| **Infrastructure Priorities** | David (Backend/Eng) | Intern Sam | **Focus vs. Noise:** Critical launch/meeting prep is being interrupted by non-essential internal communication (e.g., the "Water Bottle" incident). |
| **Marketing vs. Reality** | Sarah (Marketing) | Engineering Team | **Promised Feed vs. Tech Gap:** Marketing promised "Live" updates for the IHO presentation, but David/Michael insist on "Cached" data for stability. |

## ❓ Ambiguity Tracker (Unresolved Issues)

* **Legal Sufficiency of DAE Amendment:** It remains unclear if "completing work differently" (as per DAE) legally meets the original safety standards of a "mid-term refurbishment."
* **The "Staff Blockade":** In the Alameda meeting, the specific "city official staff members" who blocked the lease are not named, nor are their specific legal grounds fully documented.
* **Budget Source Paradox:** There is ambiguity in whether the $2M for the CAP project is coming from the **General Fund** or strictly from **Franchise Renewal Fees**.
* **Billboard Mitigation:** The "interim mitigation" on the billboard ordinance is mentioned, but its duration and legal weight are not defined.

3.  **DAE Contract Flow:** * *Update:* The mid-term refurbishment requirement was **officially rescinded** and replaced with a continuous documentation model.
4.  **Inclusionary Housing Ordinance (IHO):** * *Update:* Amendments were added specifically targeting **Safety & Wellbeing** metrics, moving away from purely financial housing metrics.

## 🎯 Purpose
This mock data simulates **bureaucratic friction**. It is ideal for training AI to detect where projects stall due to internal staff "blocks" or where technical requirements are diluted for administrative ease.
