PROJECT PROPOSAL – Learning Platform Security & GDPR Compliance
USER: Liam O’Connor (Lead Developer)
VENDOR: EduSecure Consulting
AUTHORIZED BY: Nina Shah (Lead Auditor)
PROJECT SCOPE:
1. Web application penetration testing for the full learning platform.
2. GDPR data privacy compliance audit covering user data and storage policies.
3. Detailed vulnerability report with remediation plans for identified risks.
4. Comprehensive risk documentation for internal and external stakeholders.
COST: $12,500 USD
TIMELINE: 12 business days
MANDATORY COMPLIANCE: External audit is required for GDPR certification. Internal developer-only checks are insufficient. Skipping or partially performing the audit risks regulatory fines, loss of customer trust, and potential legal exposure.
NOTES: Priority given to critical modules affecting user data and payment transactions. Minor modules may be temporarily deferred, but documented in risk logs.
