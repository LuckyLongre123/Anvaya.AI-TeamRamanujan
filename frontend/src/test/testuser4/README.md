# User 4 – Liam O’Connor

## User Info
- **Name:** Liam O’Connor
- **Role:** Lead Developer
- **Project:** Online Learning Platform Revamp

## Project Objective
The project focuses on revamping an online learning platform while ensuring **GDPR compliance** and data security. The goal is to audit critical modules handling personal data and payments, implement mitigation for vulnerabilities, and document all risk exposures. Budget constraints require careful allocation between audit costs ($12,500 USD) and ongoing development ($40k total sprint).

## Proposal
**Vendor:** EduSecure Consulting  
**Authorized By:** Nina Shah (Lead Auditor)  
**Scope:**
- Web app penetration testing  
- GDPR compliance audit  
- Vulnerability and remediation reports  
- Risk documentation for internal and external stakeholders  
**Timeline:** 12 business days  
**Mandatory Compliance:** External audit required for certification. Internal dev-only checks are insufficient. Partial audits must be documented; skipping risks fines, legal exposure, and customer trust.

## Meeting Transcript
**Title:** GDPR Compliance & Security Sync  
**Date:** Feb 12, 2024  
**Participants:** Liam O’Connor (Lead Dev), Eva Müller (CTO), Oliver Reed (CFO)  

**Highlights:**
- Critical audit modules prioritized; minor modules deferred with logged mitigation  
- Contradiction: GDPR compliance is mandatory, but partial audit executed  
- Budget cap $40k; $12.5k approved for core audit  
- Ambiguity: partial mitigation documented, regulator acceptance uncertain  
- Natural dialogue included filler words (uh, hmm) and side discussions about minor UI tasks, timeline concerns, and team capacity
